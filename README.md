# Handling Null Values in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a simple yet important concept in JavaScript: gracefully handling null or undefined values in functions.  Unexpected null values can easily lead to runtime errors, so it's crucial to incorporate checks to prevent such issues.

The `bug.js` file shows a function that correctly handles null values by returning 0 if either input is null.  The solution ensures that the function remains robust and prevents errors from occurring.
